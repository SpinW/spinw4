# 


**SpinW** (*spin-double-u*) is a Matlab library that can optimize magnetic structures using mean field theory and calculate spin wave dispersion and spin-spin correlation function for complex crystal and magnetic structures. For details check http://www.spinw.org

# Current Status
**SpinW is moving to Matlab/python/C++**, which will be the 4.0 release. This is in active devlopment and will take some time. Please checkout https://github.com/SpinW/spinw4/discussions for updates. You can also leave suggestions, questions and contributions to the project.

# Documentation
* experimental and under construction, the address can change in the future
* documentation of the master branch
* use `swdoc`/`swhelp` instead of the Matlab built-in `doc`/`help` functions to get help on SpinW
* can be also accessed from the browser: https://spinw.github.io/spinwdoc/
