### Syntax

`swplot.base(bv, {hfigure})`

### Description

BV is a matrix with dimensions of [3 3] and contains the three basis
vectors of the new coordinate system as column vectors.
 
SWPLOT.BASE(obj, {hFigure})
 
obj is a spinw object that defines the swplot coordinate system as
lattice units.
 
BV = SWPLOT.BASE
 
Returns the basis vectors stored in the swplot figure.
 

### Input Arguments

`BV`
: Either a 3x3 matrix of the new basis vectors or a spinw
  object where the new basis vectors will be the lattice
  units of the stored crystal.

`hFigure`
: Handle of the swplot figure. Default is the selected
  figure.
