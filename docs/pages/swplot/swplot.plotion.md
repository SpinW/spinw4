### Syntax

`swplot.plotion(Name,Value)`

### Description

hFigure = SWPLOT.PLOTION(...)
 
The function plots selected properties of magnetic ions stored in a SpinW
object onto an swplot figure.
 

### Input Arguments

### Name-Value Pair Arguments

`'obj'`
: SpinW object.

`'range'`
: Plotting range of the lattice parameters in lattice units,
  dimensions are [3 2]. For example to plot the first unit cell,
  use: [0 1;0 1;0 1]. Also the number unit cells can be given
  along the a, b and c directions: [2 1 2], that is equivalent to
  [0 2;0 1;0 2]. Default is the single unit cell.

`'unit'`
: Unit in which the range is defined. It can be the following
  string:
      'lu'        Lattice units (default).
      'xyz'       Cartesian coordinate system in Å units.

`'mode'`
: String, defines how the bond is plotted
      'aniso'     Ellipsoid is plotted for single ion anisotropy.
      'g'     	Ellipsoid is drawn for g-tensor.

`'scale'`
: Scaling factor for the size of the ellipsoid relative to the 
  shortest bond length. Default value is 1/3.

`'α'`
:   Transparency (α value) of the ellipsoid, default value is 
  0.3.

`'radius1'`
: Minimum radius of the ellipsoid, default value is 0.08.

`'lineWidth'`
: Line width in pt of the main circles surrounding the ellipsoid, 
  if zero no circles are drawn. Default is 0.5.

`'figure'`
: Handle of the swplot figure. Default is the selected figure.

`'legend'`
: Whether to add the plot to the legend, default value is true.

`'color'`
: Color of the ellipsoid:
      'auto'      All ellipsoid gets the color of the ion.
      'colorname' All ellipsoid will have the same given color.
      [R G B]     RGB code of the color that fix the color of all
                  ellipsoid.

`'color2'`
: Color of the main circles, default value is 'auto' when the ellipses
  will have the same color as the ellipsoids. Can be either a row
  vector of RGB code or string of a color name.

`'nMesh'`
: Resolution of the ellipse surface mesh. Integer number that is
  used to generate an icosahedron mesh with #mesh number of
  additional triangulation, default value is stored in
  swpref.getpref('nmesh')

`'nPatch'`
: Number of points on the curve for the arrows, default
  value is stored in swpref.getpref('npatch').

`'tooltip'`
: If true, the tooltips will be shown when clicking on atoms.
  Default is true.

`'shift'`
: Column vector with 3 elements, all atomic positions will be
  shifted by the given value. Default value is [0;0;0].

`'replace'`
: Replace previous atom plot if true. Default is true.

`'translate'`
: If true, all plot objects will be translated to the figure
  center. Default is false.

`'zoom'`
: If true, figure will be automatically zoomed to the ideal size.
  Default is false.

`'copy'`
: If true, a hardcopy of the spinw object will be sved in the
  figure data, otherwise just the handle of the spinw object, 
  thus the figure can be updated when the spin object changed.
  Default value is false. 

### Output Arguments

hFigure           Handle of the swplot figure.
The name of the objects that are created called 'bond'. To find the
handles and the stored data on these objects, use e.g.
  sObject = swplot.findobj(hFigure,'name','bond')
