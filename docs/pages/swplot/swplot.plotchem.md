### Syntax

`swplot.plotchem(Name,Value)`

### Description

hFigure = SWPLOT.PLOTCHEM(...)
 
The function polyhedra around selected  atoms, or chemical bonds between
atoms an swplot figure.
 

### Input Arguments

### Name-Value Pair Arguments

`'obj'`
: SpinW object.

`'range'`
: Plotting range of the lattice parameters in lattice units,
  dimensions are [3 2]. For example to plot the first unit cell,
  use: [0 1;0 1;0 1]. Also the number unit cells can be given
  along the a, b and c directions: [2 1 2], that is equivalent to
  [0 2;0 1;0 2]. Default is the single unit cell.

`'unit'`
: Unit in which the range is defined. It can be the following
  string:
      'lu'        Lattice units (default).
      'xyz'       Cartesian coordinate system in Å units.

`'mode'`
: Selects the type of the plot:
      'poly'      Draws polyhedra around the center atoms
                  (default).
      'bond'      Draws bonds between given atoms.

`'atom1'`
: Indices of atoms stored in spinw.unit_cell for the center atom
  of the polyhedra or the first atom of the bonds. Can be also a
  string that identifies the atoms by their labels.

`'atom2'`
: Indices or label of the atoms stored in spinw.unit_cell. It
  determines the vertices of the polyhedra or gives the second
  atom of a bond.

`'extend'`
: If true, only atom1 has to be within the plotting range, atom2
  will be searched +/-2 extra unit cells around the plotting
  range. If false, both atom1 and atom2 have to be within the
  unit cell.

`'limit'`
: Can be a single number which will restrict the number of
  nearest negihbours of atom1 to connect. Can be also a vector
  that defines bonds/polyhedra between atoms that are within the
  given distance range stored as a row vector [dmin dmax].
  Default is 6 to plot octahedra around atom1.

`'α'`
:   Transparency of the plotted surfaces between 0 and 1 (1 for
  opaque, 0 for transparent). Default value is 1 for bonds and
  0.3 for polyhedron.

`'color'`
: Surface color of the objects. Default is 'auto', when they are
  set to the color of atom1. [R G B] will fix the color of all
  bonds to a uniform one, can be also arbitrary color name (see
  swplot.color() function). Can be also 'none', when no faces
  will be shown.

`'color2'`
: Color of the edges of the polyhedra (unused for bonds), default
  value is 'auto' when the edge gets the same color as the faces.
  'none' will remove the edges.

`'radius0'`
: Radius of the cylinder, default value is 0.03.

`'figure'`
: Handle of the swplot figure. Default is the selected figure.

`'legend'`
: Whether to add the plot to the legend, default value is true.

`'nPatch'`
: Number of points on the curve for the cylinder, default
  value is stored in swpref.getpref('npatch').

`'tooltip'`
: If true, the tooltips will be shown when clicking on atoms.
  Default is true.

`'shift'`
: Column vector with 3 elements, all atomic positions will be
  shifted by the given value by Å units. Default value is
  [0;0;0].

`'replace'`
: Replace previous atom plot if true. Default is true.

`'translate'`
: If true, all plot objects will be translated to the figure
  center. Default is false.

`'zoom'`
: If true, figure will be automatically zoomed to the ideal size.
  Default is false.

`'copy'`
: If true, a hardcopy of the spinw object will be sved in the
  figure data, otherwise just the handle of the spinw object, 
  thus the figure can be updated when the spin object changed.
  Default value is false. 

### Output Arguments

hFigure           Handle of the swplot figure.
The name of the objects that are created called 'chem'. To find the
handles and the stored data on these objects, use e.g.
  sObject = swplot.findobj(hFigure,'name','chem')
