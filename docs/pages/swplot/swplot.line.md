### Syntax

`hline = swplot.line(rstart, rend, {linestyle}, {linewidth},{multipatch})`

### Description

Plots line disconnected segments between multiple rStart --> rEnd pairs
of coordinates.
 
hLine = SWPLOT.LINE(r, [], {lineStyle}, {lineWidth},{multiPatch})
 
Plots multiple continuous curves defined in the r matrix.
 
hLine = SWPLOT.LINE(handle,...)
 
Handle can be the handle of an axes object or a line object. It either
selects an axis to plot or a patch object (triangulated) to add vertices
and faces.
 

### Input Arguments

`handle`
: Handle of an axis or patch object. In case of patch object, the
  constructed faces will be added to the existing object instead
  of creating a new one.

`rStart`
: Coordinate(s) of the starting point, either a 3 element vector or
  a matrix with dimensions [3 nLineSegment] to plot multiple line
  segments.

`rEnd`
: Coordinate(s) of the end point, either a 3 element vector or
  a matrix with dimensions [3 nLineSegment] to plot multiple line
  segments.

`r`
: Matrix with dimensions [3 nCurve nPointPerCurve]. The function
  will plot a nCurve number of disconnected curves. The i-th
  curve will follow the x=r(1,i,:), y=r(2,i,:), z=r(3,i,:)
  (parameteric) curve.

`lineStyle`
: Line style, default value is '-' for continuous line.

`lineWidth`
: Line with in pt, default value is 0.5.

`mPatch`
: If true, a separate patch object will be created per line
  segment. Default is false, a single patch object will store all
  line segments.
