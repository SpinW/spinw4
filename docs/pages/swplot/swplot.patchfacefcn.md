### Syntax

`patchfacefcn(obj,hit,callbackfun,selection, {dlim})`

### Description

The function can find the index of the face in a patch object which was
clicked on by the mouse. The function should be used as a callback
function for the ButtonDownFcn event of patch object and it will call a
user defined function with the same arguments as the ButtonDownFcn call,
but adding an extra argument, the face index. Thus the user defined
callback function will have the following header:
 
          callbackfun(obj,hit,faceIndex)
 
The function can detect if the mouse click was on a face or on an edge of
the patch object.
 

### Examples



### Input Arguments

`obj`
: object.

`hit`
:   Hit object that contains the point where the object was hit.

`callbackfun`
:   User function that will be called in case of a click event
    on obj. It should have the following header:
        callbackfun(obj,hit,faceIndex)
    where face Index contains the index of the face that was
    clicked on, it can contain a single index or more depending
    on the selection type.

`selection`
:   String defines three diferent selection criteria when the
    callbackfun() function will be called:
        'face'  The callbackfun() will be triggered if a face
                was clicked (numel(faceIndex)==1).
        'edge'  The callbackfun() will be triggered if an edge
                is clicked (numel(faceIndex)==2).
        'all'   The callbackfun() will be triggered for both
                faces and edges.

`{dLim}`
:   Upper limit of the absolute value of the determinant that
    determines whether a point is on a plane spanned by the two
    edges of a triangle. Default value is 1e-7 (tested).
