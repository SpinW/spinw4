### Syntax

`hpatch = swplot.ellipsoid(r0,t,mesh)`

### Description

The function can draw multiple ellipsoids with a single patch command.
Significant speedup can be achieved by a single patch compared to ellipse
per patch.
 
hPatch = SWPLOT.ELLIPSOID(handle,...
 
Handle can be the handle of an axes object or a patch object. It either
selects an axis to plot or a patch object (triangulated) to add vertices
and faces.
 

### Input Arguments

`handle`
: Handle of an axis or patch object. In case of patch object, the
  constructed faces will be added to the existing object instead
  of creating a new one.

`R0`
: Center of the ellipsoid stored in a matrix with dimensions of
  [3 nEllipse].

`T`
: Transformation matrix that transforms a unit sphere to the
  ellipse via: R' = T(:,:,i)*R
  Dimensions are [3 3 nEllipse].

`mesh`
: Mesh of the ellipse surface, a triangulation class object or an
  integer that used to generate an icosahedron mesh with #mesh
  number of additional triangulation. Default value is stored in
  swpref.getpref('nmesh')
