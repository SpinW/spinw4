### Syntax

`hpatch = swploit.circle(r0, n, r, {n})`

### Description

hPatch = SWPLOIT.CIRCLE(handle,...)
 
Handle can be the handle of an axes object or a patch object. It either
selects an axis to plot or a patch object (triangulated) to add vertices
and faces.
 

### Examples

swplot.circle(zeros(3),eye(3),1,100)

### Input Arguments

`handle`
: Handle of an axis or patch object. In case of patch object, the
  constructed faces will be added to the existing object instead
  of creating a new one.

`r0`
: Center of the circle, vector with three elements.

`n`
: Vector normal to the circle surface, vector with three elements.

`R`
: Radius of the circle.

`N`
: Number of points on the curve, default value is stored in
  swpref.getpref('npatch').
