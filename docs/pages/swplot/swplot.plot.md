### Syntax

`swplot.plot(Name,Value)`

### Description

hFigure = SWPLOT.PLOT(...)
 
 

### Name-Value Pair Arguments

`'type'`
: Type of object to plot in a string. Possible options are:
      'arrow'         position specifies start and end points
      'ellipsoid'     position specifies center
      'cylinder'      position specifies start and end points
      'polyhedron'    position specifies the vertices of the
                      convex polyhedron or polygon
      'circle'        position specifies center and normal vector
      'line'          position specifies start and end points (or
                      any number of points per curve)
      'text'          position specifies the center of the text

`'position'`
: Position of the object/objects in a matrix with dimensions of
  [3 nObject 2]/[3 nObject]/[3 nObject nPoint] depending on the
  type of object. The unit of the positions is determined by the
  'unit' option.

`'name'`
: String, the name of the object. It can be used for finding the
  object handles after plotting.

`'text'`
: Text to appear in the tooltip of the swplot figure after
  clicking on the object. Can be a string that will be the same
  for all objects, or a cell of strings for different text per
  object. Default value is taken from the label option.

`'label'`
: Text to appear in the legend in a string for the same text of
  all objects or strings in a cell for multiple objects with
  dimension [1 nObject]. Default value is taken from the name
  string.

`'legend'`
: Type of legend to show the object:
      0       Do not show in legend.
      1       Colored box in legend.
      2       Dashed box in legend.
      3       Colored sphere in legend.

`'color'`
: Color of objects, either a single color or as many colors as
  many objects are given in a matrix with dimensions of [3 1]/[3
  nObject]. Values are RGB triples with values between [0 255].
  Can be also string or cell of strings with the name of the
  colors, for details see swplot.color. Default is red.

`'α'`
:   Transparency of objects (1 non-transparent, 0 transparent)
  defined as a single number for unitform transparency or as a
  row vector with nObject element to set transparency per object.
  Default value is 1.

`'unit'`
: String that determines the coordinate system:
      'lu'    Lattice units are used where the lattice is defined
              by the stored basis (default).
      'xyz'   Use the original matlab units.

`'figure'`
: Handle of the swplot figure. Default is the selected figure.

`'R'`
: Radius value of cylinder, sphere (if no 'T' is given) and
  arrow, default value is 0.06.

`'ang'`
: Angle for arrow head in ° units, default value is 15 °.

`'lHead'`
: Length of the arrow head, default value is 0.5.

`'T'`
: Transformation matrix that transforms a unit sphere to the
  ellipse via: R' = T(:,:,i)*R
  Dimensions are [3 3 nObject].

`'lineStyle'`
: Line style, default value is '-' for continuous lines. It can
  be also a vector with as many elements as many line segments.
  In this case the numbers are equivalent to the following style
  format string:
      1   '-'
      2   '--'
      3   '-.'
      4   ':'
      5   'none'

`'lineWidth'`
: Line width, default value is 0.5, can be a vector with nObject
  columns for different width per line segment.

`'fontSize'`
: Font size of text when type option is set to 'text'. Default
  value is stored in swpref.getpref('fontsize').

`'nMesh'`
: Resolution of the ellipse surface mesh. Integer number that is
  used to generate an icosahedron mesh with #mesh number of
  additional triangulation, default value is stored in
  swpref.getpref('nmesh')

`'nPatch'`
: Number of points on the curve for arrow and cylinder, default
  value is stored in swpref.getpref('npatch').

`'tooltip'`
: If true, the tooltip will be switched on at the end of the
  plot. Default is true.

`'replace'`
: If true, all object with the same name as the new plot will be
  deleted before plotting. Default is false.

`'data'`
: Arbitrary data per object that will be stored in the swplot
  figure and can be retrieved. It is stored in a cell with
  nObject number of elements.

`'translate'`
: If true, all plot objects will be translated to the figure
  center. Default is true.

`'zoom'`
: If true, figure will be automatically zoomed to the ideal size.
  Default is true.
