ISVALID   Test handle validity.
   TF = ISVALID(H) performs an element-wise check for validity on the 
   handle elements of H.  The result is a logical array of the same 
   dimensions as H, where each element is the element-wise validity 
   result.
 
   A handle is invalid if it has been deleted or if it is an element
   of a handle array and has not yet been initialized.
