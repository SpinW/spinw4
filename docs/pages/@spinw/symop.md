  generates the symmetry operators on bonds and magnetic atoms
 
  OP = SYMOP(obj)
 
  The function generates the rotation matrices that transform single ion
  anisotropy, g-tensor and exchange interaction matrices between symmetry
  equivalent positions (on atoms or bond centers). The results are cached.
