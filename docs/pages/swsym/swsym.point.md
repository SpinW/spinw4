### Syntax

`pop = swsym.point(symop, r)`

### Description

The function determines point group symmetry in an arbitrary position in
the unit cell in any space group. Returns all the generators of the point
group.
 

### Input Arguments

`symOp`
: Symmetry operators of the space group stored in a matrix
  with dimensions of [3 4 nOp].

`r`
: Position in the unit cell, dimensions are [3 1].

### Output Arguments

pOp           Point group operators, dimensions are [3 3 npOp], these
              operators act on the relative atomic positions (they are in
              the lattice coordinate system). To convert them to
              Cartesian coordinate system, use:
                  R = A*pOp(:,:,ii)*inv(A)
              Where A is a 3x3 matrix, containing the basis vectors of
              the lattice as column vectors.
