{title: sw_res, link: sw_res, summary: reads a tabulated energy resolution from a
    file and fits with polynomial, keywords: sample, sidebar: sw_sidebar, permalink: sw_res.html,
  folder: swfiles, mathjax: 'true'}

---

### Syntax

`p = sw_res(fid,poldeg,{plot})`

### Description

The file contains the FWHM energy resolution values as a function of
energy transfer in two columns, first the energy transfer values
(positive is energy loss), the second is the FWHM of the Gaussian
resolution at the given energy transfer value.
 

### Examples

To calculate the resolution at an arbitrary energy use:
pRes = sw_res(file,5,false);
Evec = linspace(0,100,501);
Eres = polyval(polyRes,Evec);
plot(Evec,Eres);

### Input Arguments

`fid`
: String, path to the resolution file or a matrix with the
  same format as the data file.

`polDeg`
: Degree of the fitted polynomial to the instrumental
  resolution data. Default is 5.

`plot`
: If true the resolution will be plotted, optional, default
  is true.

### Output Arguments

p             Returns the coefficients for a polynomial p(x) of Â° n
              that is a best fit (in a least-squares sense) for the resolution data
              in y. The coefficients in p are in descending powers, and
              the length of p is n+1.
              p(x)=p_1*x^n+p_2*x^(n-1)+...+p_n*x+p_(n+1).
