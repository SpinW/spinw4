{title: spinw.powspec method, link: spinw.powspec, summary: calculates powder averaged
    spin wave spectra, keywords: sample, sidebar: sw_sidebar, permalink: spinw_powspec,

### Syntax
 
`spectra = powspec(obj,QA)`
 
`spectra = powspec(___,Name,Value)`
 
### Description
 
`spectra = powspec(obj,QA)` calculates powder averaged spin wave spectrum
by averaging over spheres with different radius around origin in
reciprocal space. This way the spin wave spectrum of polycrystalline
samples can be calculated. This method is not efficient for low
dimensional (2D, 1D) magnetic lattices. To speed up the calculation with
mex files use the `swpref.setpref('usemex',true)` option. 
 
`spectra = powspec(___,Value,Name)` specifies additional parameters for
the calculation. For example the function can calculate powder average of
arbitrary spectral function, if it is specified using the `specfun`
option. 
 
### Example
 
Using only a few lines of code one can calculate the powder spectrum of
the triangular lattice antiferromagnet ($$S=1$$, $$J=1$$) between $$Q=0$$ and 3
Å$$^{-1}$$ (the lattice parameter is 3 Å).
 
```matlab
tri = sw_model('triAF',1);
E = linspace(0,4,100);
Q = linspace(0,4,300);
triSpec = tri.powspec(Q,'Evect',E,'nRand',1e3);
sw_plotspec(triSpec);
```

### Input arguments
 
`obj`
: [spinw](spinw) object.
 
`QA`
: Vector containing the $$Q$$ values in units of the inverse of the length
unit (see [spinw.unit](spinw_unit)) with default unit being Å$$^{-1}$$. The
value are stored in a row vector with $$n_Q$$ elements.
 
### Name-Value Pair Arguments
 
`specfun`
: Function handle of a solver. Default value is `@spinwave`. It is
  currently tested with two functions:
 
  * `spinw.spinwave` 	Powder average spin wave spectrum.
  * `spinw.scga`      Powder averaged diffuse scattering spectrum.
 
`nRand`
: Number of random orientations per `QA` value, default value is 100.
 
`Evect`
: Row vector, defines the center/edge of the energy bins of the
  calculated output, number of elements is $$n_E$$. The energy units are
  defined by the `spinw.unit.kB` property. Default value is an edge bin
  `linspace(0,1.1,101)`.
 
`binType`
: String, determines the type of bin, possible options:
  * `'cbin'`    Center bin, the center of each energy bin is given.
  * `'ebin'`    Edge bin, the edges of each bin is given.
 
  Default value is `'ebin'`.
 
`'T'`
: Temperature to calculate the Bose factor in units
  depending on the Boltzmann constant. Default value taken from
  `obj.single_ion.T` value.
 
`'title'`
: Gives a title to the output of the simulation.
 
`'extrap'`
: If true, arbitrary additional parameters are passed over to
  the spectrum calculation function.
 
`'fibo'`
: If true, instead of random sampling of the unit sphere the Fibonacci
  numerical integration is implemented as described in
  [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37 (2004)
  11591](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/37/48/005/meta).
  The number of points on the sphere is given by the largest
  Fibonacci number below `nRand`. Default value is false.
 
`'imagChk'`
: Checks that the imaginary part of the spin wave dispersion is
  smaller than the energy bin size. Default value is true.
 
`'component'`
: See [sw_egrid](sw_egrid) for the description of this parameter.
 
The function also accepts all parameters of [spinw.spinwave](spinw_spinwave) with the
most important parameters are:
 
`'formfact'`
: If true, the magnetic form factor is included in the spin-spin
  correlation function calculation. The form factor coefficients are
  stored in `obj.unit_cell.ff(1,:,atomIndex)`. Default value is `false`.
 
`'formfactfun'`
: Function that calculates the magnetic form factor for given $$Q$$ value.
  value. Default value is `@sw_mff`, that uses a tabulated coefficients
  for the form factor calculation. For anisotropic form factors a user
  defined function can be written that has the following header:
  ```matlab
  F = formfactfun(atomLabel,Q)
  ```
  where the parameters are:
  * `F`           row vector containing the form factor for every input 
                  $$Q$$ value
  * `atomLabel`   string, label of the selected magnetic atom
  * `Q`           matrix with dimensions of $$[3\times n_Q]$$, where each
                  column contains a $$Q$$ vector in $$Å^{-1}$$ units.
 
`'gtensor'`
: If true, the g-tensor will be included in the spin-spin correlation
  function. Including anisotropic g-tensor or different
  g-tensor for different ions is only possible here. Including a simple
  isotropic g-tensor is possible afterwards using the [sw_instrument](sw_instrument)
  function.
 
`'hermit'`
: Method for matrix diagonalization with the following logical values:
  
  * `true`    using Colpa's method (for details see [J.H.P. Colpa, Physica 93A (1978) 327](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378437178901607)),
              the dynamical matrix is converted into another Hermitian
              matrix, that will give the real eigenvalues.
  * `false`   using the standard method (for details see [R.M. White, PR 139 (1965) A450](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.139.A450))
              the non-Hermitian $$\mathcal{g}\times \mathcal{H}$$ matrix
              will be diagonalised, which is computationally less
              efficient. Default value is `true`.
 
{% include note.html content=" Always use Colpa's method, except when imaginary eigenvalues are
  expected. In this case only White's method work. The solution in this
  case is wrong, however by examining the eigenvalues it can give a hint
  where the problem is." %}
 
`'tid'`
: Determines if the elapsed and required time for the calculation is
  displayed. The default value is determined by the `tid` preference
  stored in [swpref]. The following values are allowed (for more details
  see [sw_timeit](sw_timeit)):
  * `0` No timing is executed.
  * `1` Display the timing in the Command Window.
  * `2` Show the timing in a separat pup-up window.
 
The function accepts some parameters of [spinw.scga] with the most important
parameters are:
 
`'nInt'`
: Number of $$Q$$ points where the Brillouin zone is sampled for the
  integration.
 
### Output Arguments
 
`spectra`
: structure with the following fields:
 
  * `swConv` The spectra convoluted with the dispersion. The center
    of the energy bins are stored in `spectra.Evect`. Dimensions are
    $$[n_E\times n_Q]$$.
  * `hklA` Same $$Q$$ values as the input `hklA`.
  * `Evect` Contains the bins (edge values of the bins) of the energy transfer
    values, dimensions are $$[1\times n_E+1]$$.
  * `param` Contains all the input parameters.
