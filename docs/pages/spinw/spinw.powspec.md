### Syntax
 
`spectra = powspec(obj,QA)`
 
`spectra = powspec(___,Name,Value)`
 
### Description
 
`spectra = powspec(obj,QA)` calculates powder averaged spin wave spectrum
by averaging over spheres with different radius around origin in
reciprocal space. This way the spin wave spectrum of polycrystalline
samples can be calculated. This method is not efficient for low
dimensional (2D, 1D) magnetic lattices. To speed up the calculation with
mex files use the `swpref.setpref('usemex',true)` option. 
 
`spectra = powspec(___,Value,Name)` specifies additional parameters for
the calculation. For example the function can calculate powder average of
arbitrary spectral function, if it is specified using the `specfun`
option. 
 
### Input arguments
 
`obj`
: [spinw](spinw.html) object.
 
`QA`
: Vector containing the $$Q$$ values in units of the inverse of the length
unit (see [spinw.unit]) with default unit being Ã…$$^{-1}$$. The
value are stored in a row vector with $$n_Q$$ elements.
 
### Name-Value Pair Arguments
 
`specfun`
: Function handle of a solver. Default value is `@spinwave`. It is
  currently tested with two functions:
 
  * `spinw.spinwave` 	Powder average spin wave spectrum.
  * `spinw.scga`      Powder averaged diffuse scattering spectrum.
 
`nRand`
: Number of random orientations per `QA` value, default value is 100.
 
`Evect`
: Row vector, defines the center/edge of the energy bins of the
  calculated output, number of elements is $$n_E$$. The energy units are
  defined by the `spinw.unit.kB` property. Default value is an edge bin
  `linspace(0,1.1,101)`.
 
`binType`
: String, determines the type of bin, possible options:
  * `'cbin'`    Center bin, the center of each energy bin is given.
  * `'ebin'`    Edge bin, the edges of each bin is given.
 
  Default value is `'ebin'`.
 
T         Temperature to calculate the Bose factor in units
          depending on the Boltzmann constant. Default is taken from
          obj.single_ion.T value.
title     Gives a title string to the simulation that is saved in the
          output.
extrap    If true, arbitrary additional parameters are passed over to
          the spectrum calculation function.
fibo      If true, instead of random sampling of the unit sphere the
          Fibonacci numerical integration is implemented as described in:
          J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37 (2004) 11591
          The number of points on the sphere is given by the largest
          Fibonacci number below nRand. Default is false.
imagChk   Checks that the imaginary part of the spin wave dispersion is
          smaller than the energy bin size. Default is true.
component See the help of sw_egrid() function for description.
 
The function accepts all options of spinw.spinwave() with the most
important options are:
 
formfact      If true, the magnetic form factor is included in the
              spin-spin correlation function calculation. Default value
              is false.
formfactfun   Function that calculates the magnetic form factor for given
              Q value. Default value is @sw_mff(), that uses a tabulated
              coefficients for the form factor calculation. For
              anisotropic form factors a user defined function can be
              written that has the following header:
                  F = @formfactfun(atomLabel,Q)
              where the parameters are:
                  F   row vector containing the form factor for every
                      input Q value
                  atomLabel string, label of the selected magnetic atom
                  Q   matrix with dimensions of [3 nQ], where each column
                      contains a Q vector in Angstrom^-1 units.
gtensor       If true, the g-tensor will be included in the spin-spin
              correlation function. Including anisotropic g-tensor or
              different g-tensor for different ions is only possible
              here.
hermit        Method for matrix diagonalization:
                  true      J.H.P. Colpa, Physica 93A (1978) 327,
                  false     R.M. White, PR 139 (1965) A450.
              Colpa: the grand dynamical matrix is converted into another
                     Hermitian matrix, that will give the real
                     eigenvalues.
              White: the non-Hermitian g*H matrix will be diagonalised,
                     that is not the elegant method.
              Advise:
              Always use Colpa's method, except when small imaginary
              eigenvalues are expected. In this case only White's method
              work. The solution in this case is wrong, however by
              examining the eigenvalues it can give a hint where the
              problem is.
              Default is true.
 
The function accepts some options of spinw.scga() with the most important
options are:
 
nInt      Number of Q points where the Brillouin zone is sampled for the
          integration.
 
Output:
 
'spectra' is a struct type variable with the following fields:
swConv    The spectra convoluted with the dispersion. The center
          of the energy bins are stored in spectra.Evect. Dimensions are
          [nE nQ].
hklA      Same Q values as the input hklA [1 nQ]. Evect
          Contains the input energy transfer values, dimensions are
          [1 nE].
param     Contains all the input parameters.
obj       The copy of the input obj object.
Evect     Energy grid converted to edge bins.
 
Example:
 
tri = sw_model('triAF',1);
E = linspace(0,4,100);
Q = linspace(0,4,300);
triSpec = tri.powspec(Q,'Evect',E,'nRand',1e3);
sw_plotspec(triSpec);
 
The example calculates the powder spectrum of the triangular lattice
antiferromagnet (S=1, J=1) between Q = 0 and 3 A^-1 (the lattice
parameter is 3 Angstrom).
