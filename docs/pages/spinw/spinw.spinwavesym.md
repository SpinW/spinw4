### Syntax
  
`spectra = spinwavesym(obj,Name,Value)`
  
### Description
  
`spectra = spinwavesym(obj,Name,Value)` calculates symbolic spin wave
dispersion as a function of $$Q$$. The function can deal with arbitrary
magnetic structure and magnetic interactions as well as single ion
anisotropy and magnetic field. Biquadratic exchange interactions are also
implemented, however only for $$k=0$$ magnetic structures.
  
If the magnetic propagation vector is non-integer, the dispersion is
calculated using a coordinate system rotating from cell to cell. In this
case the Hamiltonian has to fulfill this extra rotational symmetry.
   
The method works for incommensurate structures, however the calculated
omega dispersion does not contain the $$\omega(\mathbf{k}\pm \mathbf{k}_m)$$ terms that has to be
added manually.
   
The method for matrix diagonalization is according to R.M. White, PR 139
(1965) A450. The non-Hermitian g*H matrix will be diagonalised.
   
### Examples
 
The first section of the example calculates the symbolic spin wave
spectrum. Unfortunatelly the symbolic expression needs manipulations to
bring it to readable form. To check the solution, the second section
converts the symbolic expression into a numerical vector and the third
section plots the real and imaginary part of the solution.
 
```matlab
tri = sw_model('triAF',1)
tri.symbolic(true)
tri.genmagstr('mode','direct','k',[1/3 1/3 0],'S',[1 0 0])
symSpec = tri.spinwave
pretty(symSpec.omega)
```

### Input Arguments
  
`obj`
: [spinw](spinw) object.
  
### Name-Value Pair Arguments
  
`'hkl'`
: Symbolic definition of $$Q$$ vector. Default is the general $$Q$$
  point:
  ```matlab
  hkl = [sym('h') sym('k') sym('l')]
  ```
  
`'eig'`
: If true the symbolic Hamiltonian is diagonalised symbolically. For
  large matrices (many magnetic atom per unit cell) this might be
  impossible. Set `eig` to `false` to output only the quadratic
  Hamiltonian. Default is `true`.
  
`'vect'`
: If `true` the eigenvectors are also calculated. Default is `false`.
  
`'tol'`
: Tolerance of the incommensurability of the magnetic
  ordering wavevector. Deviations from integer values of the
  ordering wavevector smaller than the tolerance are
  considered to be commensurate. Default value is $$10^{-4}$$.
  
`'norm'`
: Whether to produce the normalized symbolic eigenvectors. It can be
  impossible for large matrices, in that case set it to
  `false`. Default is `true`.
  
`'title'`
: Gives a title string to the simulation that is saved in the
  output.
 
### Output Arguments
 
`spectra`
: Structure, with the following fields:
  * `omega`   Calculated spin wave dispersion, dimensins are
              $$[2*n_{magExt}\times n_{hkl}]$$, where $$n_{magExt}$$ is the number of magnetic
              atoms in the extended unit cell.
  * `V0`      Eigenvectors of the quadratic Hamiltonian.
  * `V`       Normalized eigenvectors of the quadratic Hamiltonian.
  * `ham`     Symbolic matrix of the Hamiltonian.
  * `incomm`  Whether the spectra calculated is incommensurate or not.
  * `obj`     The clone of the input `obj`.
